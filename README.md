## üíæÔ∏è Installation

The recommended way to use gdx-pay is via dependency management with Gradle or Maven. Artifacts are available in
[Snapshot Repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/com/badlogicgames/gdx-controllers/).

*project-root/build.gradle:*

    ext {
        gdxControllersVersion = '2.0.0-SNAPSHOT'
    }

Add the following dependencies:

#### core:
```
implementation "com.badlogicgames.gdx-controllers:gdx-controllers-core:$gdxControllersVersion"
```

#### desktop:

##### Original
```
implementation "com.badlogicgames.gdx-controllers:gdx-controllers-desktop:$gdxControllersVersion"
```

##### This Git
```
api 'com.github.LucasFebatis.gdx-controllers:gdx-controllers-desktop:master-SNAPSHOT'
```

#### android:
```
implementation "com.badlogicgames.gdx-controllers:gdx-controllers-android:$gdxControllersVersion"
```
Proguard setting:
```
-keep class com.badlogic.gdx.controllers.android.AndroidControllers { *; }
```

#### ios:
```
implementation "com.badlogicgames.gdx-controllers:gdx-controllers-ios:$gdxControllersVersion"
```
`robovml.xml` needs the following line added to `forceLinkClasses`:
```
<pattern>com.badlogic.gdx.controllers.IosControllerManager</pattern> 
```
#### html:
```
implementation "com.badlogicgames.gdx-controllers:gdx-controllers-core:$gdxControllersVersion:sources"
implementation "com.badlogicgames.gdx-controllers:gdx-controllers-gwt:$gdxControllersVersion:sources"
```
You also need to add the following file to your GdxDefinition.gwt.xml in your html project:
```
<inherits name="com.badlogic.gdx.controllers" />
<inherits name="com.badlogic.gdx.controllers.controllers-gwt"/>
```
